    "## Converting from HSV or HSL to RGB\n",
    "\n",
    "Why conversions among HSV, HSL, and RGB color systems? For example, we want to create faded or dimmed versions of main colors; or, we want to create sequential or diverging color ramp sets off of a particular theme color - and a good way to do that is to keep the hue and use a sequence of different brightness or lightness. For this purpose, we need to convert an RGB hex into its corresponding HSV/HSL, tweak the V or L, before converting the new colors back to RGB hexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the function that has `hue`, `saturation`, and `brightness`/`lightness` as input, and outputs the HEX of this color. The difference between the HSB and HSL systems is documented in this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).\n",
    "The algorithms of these conversions are found on [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/index.html). Note that HSB and HSV bear the same meaning."
