    "## Converting from HSV or HSL to RGB\n",
    "\n",
    "Why conversions among HSV, HSL, and RGB color systems? Because we want to create sequential or diverging color ramp sets off of a particular theme color - and a good way to do that is to keep the hue and use a sequence of different brightness or lightness. For this purpose, we need to convert an RGB hex into its corresponding HSV/HSL, tweak the V or L, before converting the new colors back to RGB hexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the function that has `hue`, `saturation`, and `brightness`/`lightness` as input, and outputs the HEX of this color. The difference between the HSB and HSL systems is documented in this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).\n",
    "The algorithms of these conversions are found on [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/index.html). Note that HSB and HSV bear the same meaning."

    "## Creating monochromatic color ramps\n",
    "In this section, let's try to make a functionality to create a **monochromatic color ramp** basing off of a theme color. This color ramp consists of a specific number of fading colors, the first being the theme color, and the last being white (#FFFFFF). Monochromatic, or sequential, color ramps, are used to demonstrate a values that vary only in extent (not in direction), where the theme color denotes the strongest or highest value, and the faded colors closer to the background color denote lower values. The background color (white or black) denotes zero."

On a white background, we increasing the lightness values until the color becomes white (denoting zero); on a black background, vice versa."

For this purpose, a diverging color ramp employs **two** theme colors, denoting the highest value in each direction.
